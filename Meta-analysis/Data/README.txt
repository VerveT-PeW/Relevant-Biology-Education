This repository contains data (research articles) related to the conducted meta-analysis. The structure in the folder of each journal is organized as follows:

    Used Data: Contains the full-text articles that were included and analyzed in the meta-analysis.

    Non-scope Original Top 200: Contains the full-text articles that were part of the original top 200 sampled documents, but which were not within the scope of the meta-analysis and therefore not included in the final analysis.

Please note that a number of articles are not included in this repository due to file size limitations. If an article is referenced in the documentation but the corresponding file is not found here, it is because the file was too large to upload and could not be further compressed.

If you would like access to any of these missing articles, please contact the researcher at t.p.w.vervenne@uva.nl
