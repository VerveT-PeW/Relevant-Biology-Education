Overview

This repository contains the complete dataset and associated materials used in the research article:
“Why Do I Have to Know This?”: Uncovering the Core of Relevant Biological Education Through a Mixed-Methods Approach" by T.P.W. Vervenne.

The study employed a mixed-methods approach, incorporating student and researcher questionnaires, qualitative interviews, and a meta-analysis of relevant literature to explore what constitutes "relevance" in biological education.

All materials are organized into six structured folders to support transparency, reproducibility, and reuse.

Folder Structure
